# Data documentation

Datasets are identified by their folder name, with the following structure:

```
[year-month-day]-[subject_initials]-[task_description]
```

When documenting a dataset:
 - [ ] Keep the subject's identity anonymous by using only their initials (John Doe -> jd)
 - [ ] Make sure to include subject's age and handedness (right-handed/left-handed)
 - [ ] Write a short description of what's being recorded
 - [ ] Write down the exact electrode placement and channel number used when recording the dataset

## [`2020-02-08-jv-baseline-activity-no-labels`](2020-02-08-jv-baseline-activity-no-labels)

Contains ~4 minutes worth of baseline EEG activity. The subject remained calm and sit down.

The goal of this recording was to capture a baseline for the subject and to verify artifacts were easily identifiable.

At certain points the subject blinks, moves his eyes around, clenches his jaw, moves his head left and right and moves his arms.
