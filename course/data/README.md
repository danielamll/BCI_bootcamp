Contains ~4 minutes worth of baseline EEG activity. The subject remained calm and sit down.

The goal of this recording was to capture a baseline for the subject and to verify artifacts were easily identifiable.

At certain points the subject blinks, moves his eyes around, clenches his jaw, moves his head left and right and moves his arms.
